## How to install:

* Move "ALC255.plist" to a place/folder where the file won't get deleted. ALCPlugFix reads this file every time macOS starts and wakes from sleep.
* Run "install.sh" from terminal
* Drag "ALC255.plist" to the terminal window
* When the installation finishes, go to Settings-Security & Privacy and allow ALCPlugFix to run
* Reboot
* Enjoy!
